Project for learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP). 

[TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is an open-source curriculum to learn full-stack web development. This is the second project they assign to their students: a simple rock paper scissors game, using JavaScript.

In the project’s assignment, it said to play only in the console and that creating an interface wasn’t necessary. But since I’m studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I decided to use all three technologies in the same project to practice.

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to apply and practice the JavaScript concepts from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) by creating a Rock Paper Scissors game. This project helped reinforce problem-solving skills and the fundamentals of JavaScript logic.

## Content
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) introduced the Rock Paper Scissors game, originally designed to be played in the console. However, to improve my skills, I decided to expand the project by creating a graphical interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

The game follows the classic rules: the player chooses rock, paper, or scissors and plays against a random computer choice. The match consists of five rounds, and the winner is the one with the most victories.  

This project was a great opportunity to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts, such as functions, conditional structures, and user interaction. Additionally, I improved my CSS styling and HTML structuring to make the game more dynamic and visually appealing.
